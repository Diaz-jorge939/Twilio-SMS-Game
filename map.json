Dad was a scientist, an engineer working for the space station. Mom worked in pharmaceuticals. Their house was on a hill, and they were going about their day. A meteor had been brought to attention a few years ago and dad and his co-workers have been on meteor watch because one stray meteor is heading towards Earth. News of the meteor attracted attention, news anchors would give occasional updates of the meteor, while small groups around the world have exclaimed that the end is near. Majority of the population were not worried and continued living their life. Both parents leave to go to work and the player is left alone. The teen checks the news, and the news anchor alerts everyone with an important broadcast: “Incoming on Meteor watch, the meteor is directly heading to Earth and is traveling at an indescribable speed. Today is the day that the end is near. During the time of despair, the teen did not expect it to happen. On the bright side, the parents have prepared for this, due to their awareness and paranoia. A few years ago, Dad showed the teenager a prototype aircraft, along with supplies for a future voyage into space. The teen decided to risk using the prototype aircraft, rather than doing nothing and waiting for the inevitable. ",

Suddenly, the force of the aircraft changed, and the aircraft had lost control, jostling the teenager in the cabin and a loud clang came from the aircraft, along with a loud thud from the teen.
